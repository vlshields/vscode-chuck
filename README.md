# vscodium-chuck

There is no plugin available on open vsx and for some strange reason I was unable to get an access code to publish this plugin in the official registry. Therefore, I have uploaded it here.

**Important Update**

The [original author](https://github.com/forrcaho/vscode-chuck) of the vscode ChucK extension now includes a .vsix package for vscodium. I recommend using  his version.

## Installation 

Download the .vsix [here](https://github.com/forrcaho/vscode-chuck/blob/main/chuck-1.0.3.vsix). From codium, click on the three dots in the extention pane and select "Install from VSIX". Select your recently downloaded .vsix file.
